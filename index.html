        Console Web App
    </h1>
        <p>
            This is My First Project in VS Code. VS Code is an IDE that We can Use to Create Amazing Mobile Apps, Web Apps and
            Games Too. We can Easily Set It Up by Allow Eveything and Clicking Next and Install.

            Console Screens are Helpfull to Test, Debug our Apps. It is Very Usefull. To Open It, We Can Right Click and Select Inspect and Select Console at the Top. We Can Print Anything in the Console by typing 'console.log("the text you want to type here in double quotes becuase a text is a string.")'.

    <script>
         
          var name = 'sameeraj';
          var lastname = ' g';
          var combinedname = name + lastname;
          console.log(combinedname.toUpperCase());

         var firstnumber = 3;
         var secondnumber = 6;

         console.log("The Sum of the Two Numbers is " + firstnumber + secondnumber);

         console.log("THE SQUARE  ROOT OF THE FIRST NUMBER IS " + Math.sqrt(firstnumber));
         console.log("THE SQUARE  ROOT OF THE SECOND NUMBER IS " + Math.sqrt(secondnumber));

        var firstsquareroot = Math.sqrt(firstnumber);
        var secondsquareroot = Math.sqrt(secondnumber);

        var square_root = firstsquareroot + secondsquareroot;

         console.log("THE sum of the square roots of the two numbers is " + square_root)
